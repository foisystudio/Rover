# Rover
A raspberry pi rover

My first attempt at building anything robotic. The Ultamate goal of this to eventually build a "Beer Excreeting Efficent Robot" AKA "BEER bot" :)

The Goal at this point it to create a rover that can drive around a course and be 90% hit free (Sonar). I would also like to add some sort of video object dection and implement it into the object avoidance. 

So far I am just dabiling in basic robotics. The build consists of the following:

Raspberry PI 3b

16GB micro sd card

2 x Sonar <ADD PART #>

Pi Camera

4 x Wheels - 4 x 3-6V DC motors - Plastic Chasis --- All part of a kit off of Amazon

Motor Controller <ADD PART#>

Bread Board

4AA battery holder

USB Power Bank 20100mAh(2 outputs @ 2.4A)




Milestones:

Video being served via a webpage(Not my code) it is a bit choppy but works for my purpouses at the moment. 
The ability to drive via a keyboard commands. 
Some rudementry autonomas driving but need quite a bit of work. 
  Decision makeing algorythim is quite rudementry and most likely flawed.
