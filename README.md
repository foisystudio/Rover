# Rover
A raspberry pi rover

My first attempt at building anything robotic. The Ultamate goal of this to eventually build a "Beer Excreeting Efficent Robot" AKA "BEER bot" :)

So far I am just dabiling in basic robotics. The build consists of the following:
Raspberry PI 3b
16GB micro sd card
2 x Sonar <ADD PART #>
Pi Camera
4 x Wheels - 4 x 3-6V DC motors - Plastic Chasis --- All part of a kit off of Amazon
Motor Controller <ADD PART#>
Bread Board
4AA battery holder
USB Power Bank (2 outputs)


The Goal at this point it to create a rover that can drive around a course and be 90% hit free (Sonar). I would also like to add some sort of object dection and implement it into the object avoidance.
